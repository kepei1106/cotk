"can someone explain xen + ubuntu to me? xen is a type 1 hypervisor, so it sits on the hardware directly, and acts like an operating system itself, yet, i have to install ubuntu, then install xen, so doesn't this mean xen sits on ubuntu and not directly on the hardware? __eou__ __eot__ i think xen has some notion of a priviledged guest. think of it as a admin guest who can ""sudo"" and make the hypervisor do things (like allocate for a new guest) __eou__ __eot__ so is xen a type 1 hypervisor or not? __eou__ or is it that we are using ubuntu to bootstrap installing xen and then on the next reboot just running xen? __eou__ __eot__ In Xen systems the Xen hypervisor is the lowest and most privileged software layer.[2] This layer supports one or more guest operating systems, scheduled on the physical CPUs. The first guest operating system, called in Xen terminology domain 0 (dom0) is executed automatically when the hypervisor boots and receives special management privileges and direct access to all physical hardware by default. The system administrator __eou__ can log into dom0 in order to manage any additional guest operating systems, called user domains (domU) in Xen terminology. __eou__ __eot__ so dom0 = ubuntu ? __eou__ __eot__ presumably __eou__ __eot__ because if i installed xen then ubuntu, i can see what you're saying, but i'm installing ubuntu then xen.. __eou__ __eot__ but you need something to install xen. xen can talk to the hardware, but it doesnt have any userspace tools to allow you to control the hardware. without dom0 it will boot and just sit there __eou__ __eot__ when i do a hard reboot on my physical computer, what am i booting back into? xen or ubuntu? __eou__ __eot__ technically both __eou__ __eot__ so that means i boot back into xen, and somehow, i log into ubuntu = dom0 to do my manipulations? __eou__ wow, that's confusing, i'm not even sure how i would explain that in writing __eou__ (i'm making my own wiki for self-cosumption) __eou__ __eot__ think of xen like the kernel and dom0 like the initrd+root filesystem . sure you can boot a kernel but thats not very useful. you need that userspace to be able to do anything __eou__ __eot__ thanks.. after ubuntu + xen is installed, then it seems easy to explain, but the fact that ubuntu is installed first and xen second, and then reading documents that xen sits on the hardware layer doesn't make sense __eou__ __eot__ well xen doesn't have an installer. so you install ubuntu, and then you install xen and use ubuntu to set xen up as the hypervisor and also configure the current ubuntu as dom0, then the next time you reboot xen starts and brings up dom0 __eou__ __eot__ if u installed ubuntu, then matlab (in this order), you wouldn't say, matlab sits on the hardware, it actually sits on ubuntu which then sits on hardware, i guess i'm trying to make such an analogy and it's confusing me __eou__ __eot__ ","im just guessing since i've never used xen, but that would make sense to me __eou__","Well, it work for me this way. __eou__",yes i did and unless you boot to the issue and paste that log there is no problem... __eou__,thank you __eou__, in gnome-terminal? or some other terminal app? __eou__,"just wanted to confirm, since I do not want to commit the same mistake again __eou__",am not using it for a server __eou__,is there an option to continue the install __eou__,"a couple ways, but it amounts to reinstalling grub. so see !grub for instructions __eou__",I don't know where is the direcotry? __eou__
