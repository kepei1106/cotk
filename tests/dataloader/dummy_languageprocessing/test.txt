if it were anyone but turold' s son .
colwyn is a great fighter .
in the fortress , you will face more than the slayers .
you will face the beast , who is their leader .
in a cave on the highest peak .
without the glaive , you will never be able to reach lyssa .
i might have been sucked to my death while you stood there gawking !
where is this place ?
if the invaders conquer , you' il be slaves with the rest of us .
noble sentiments , but we fight for profit .
you know what i mean ?
the profit' s freedom .
how did you know i had sons ?
if the slayers conquer krull , your sons will be enslaved forever .
i saw you save the boy from a spear .
that' s what friends are supposed to do for each other .
i recognise the place now .
we' re in sight of the trees , brother .
mamma' s boy is holding out .
